1. When do we use two instances?

If we have multiple environments like development/testing/staging.

2. Try to compare a node catalog with a telephone directory.

You can compare a person who calls a number out of the phone directory
with a db2 client connecting to a database or attaching an instance. 


3. Why do we need database aliases?

if I have a database named SAMPLE, 
I can catalog it as SAMP_USR â€“ and then only have users connecting in to SAMP_USR. 
If I then want to prevent users from connecting, 
I can uncatalog the alias SAMP_USR, 
and the users who were connecting in to SAMP_USR will not be able to connect, 
but I or anyone connecting into SAMPLE will be able to.

4. Name some system objects.
- Db2 catalog
    Db2 maintains a set of tables that contain information about the data that Db2 controls. 
    These tables are collectively known as the catalog.
- Db2 directory 
    The Db2 directory contains information that Db2 uses during normal operation.
- Buffer pools
    Buffer pools are areas of virtual storage that temporarily store pages of table spaces or indexes.

5. Do not mix up database catalog and system catalog - tell the difference.

6. What is the difference between connecting to a database and attaching to an instance?
    Connecting to databases defines on which database sql commands should be executed.
    The ATTACH command enables an application to specify the instance
    at which instance-level commands are to be executed. 
    This instance can be the current instance, 
    another instance on the same workstation, or an instance on a remote workstation.
