1.
How many instances are available?
- db2ilist
What is the current instance?
- db2 get instance 
How many databases are cataloged in the DB2 instance?
- db2 list database directory

2.Connect to the database SAMPLE and select from the EMPLOYEE table.
    Insert another employee into the EMPLOYEE table with your firstname and
    lastname.
- db2 connect to sample 
- db2 insert into employee(EMPNO, FIRSTNME, LASTNAME, EDLEVEL) values(3001, 'Noah', 'Scholz', 20)




4.
- set db2instance=DEVELOP
- db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP
- update dbm cfg using SVCENAME db2c_develop
open C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\services and add
db2c_DEVELOP 50004/TCP
- db2start
- db2sampl 
Configure your windows firewall to allow inbound communication via
TCP port 50004

5-6.
- set db2instance=DB2
- db2 catalog tcpip node RMTNODE remote <ip-addr> SERVER 50004 REMOTE_INSTANCE DEVELOP
- db2 catalog database SAMPLE as RMTSAMP at node RMTNODE AUTHENTICATION SERVER
Why using a database alias?
    Because we have database with the same name one local one remote
7. Examine the node and database directories, for each instance separately
- set db2instance=DB2
- db2 list node directory
- db2 list database directory

- set db2instance=DEVELOP
- db2 list node directory
- db2 list database directory

8. Connect to the remote RMTSAMP database as user Administrator.
- db2 connect to RMTSAMP USER Administrator USING Database22ws
8.1 Show the proof that you really see the remote EMPLOYEE table of your classmate instead of yours.
- db2 select * from employee
    Look at last row if classmate has inserted his/her name it will be there.

9. Open a second DB2 Command Window. Let user Su connect to the local
SAMPLE database using Lab2-Usr as password. Get a list of all tables.
- db2 connect to sample user Su using Lab2-Usr
- db2 list tables

10. Open a third DB2 Command Window. Let user Bob connect to the remote
RMTSAMP database using Lab2-Usr as password. Get a list of all tables.
- db2 connect to RMTSAMP user Bob using Lab2-Usr 
- db2 list tables

11. Switch back to your first DB2 Command Window. List out all connections
to the current instance DB2. Which applications do you expect to be
connected, which ones are missing, why are they missing?
- set db2instance=DB2
- db2 list applications 
    only Su connection gets listed because
    all other connection are either to connected to DEVELOP (classmates connection)
    or connected to remote database (Bob)

12. Attach to node RMTNODE. List out all the connections to RMTNODE
- db2 attach to RMTNODE

13. Force the application of Bob to stop.
- db2 force application (<application handler>)

14. ???

15. Detach from node RMNODE.
- db2 detach
