Talk about threats on a computer system. What are the counter measures?

    Threats on a computer system include:

        - Viruses and malware that can damage or steal data
        - Unauthorized access or hacking attempts
        - Denial of service attacks, which can make a system unavailable to users
        - Physical damage or destruction of hardware
        - Natural disasters, such as fires or floods
        - Human error or mistakes, such as accidentally deleting important files

    In the context of DB2 database management, some counter measures that can be taken to mitigate these threats include:

        - Installing and regularly updating antivirus and anti-malware software
        - Implementing strong password policies and using two-factor authentication
        - Implementing firewalls and other network security measures
        - Implementing regular backups of data to protect against loss or corruption
        - Ensuring physical security of hardware, such as keeping servers in a secure location
        - Providing training to users on security best practices and safe computing habits.


Some key differences between safety and security include:

        Safety measures are typically reactive and designed
        to prevent or mitigate the effects of accidents or incidents, 
        while security measures are proactive and designed to prevent or deter 
        threats from occurring in the first place.
        Safety measures are often focused on physical aspects, 
        such as protecting against falls or fires, 
        while security measures often focus on protecting against digital or informational threats, 
        such as hacking or espionage.
        Safety measures are often mandatory and regulated by law, 
        while security measures are often optional and implemented 
        based on an organization's specific needs and risks.


What is the advantage of relying on an authentication facility outside the DB2-System?

        One advantage of relying on an authentication facility outside the DB2 system
        is that it can provide a centralized and consistent way of managing
        user authentication and access control. This can make it easier to manage access to the DB2 system, 
        as well as other systems or resources within an organization.

        Another advantage is that an external authentication
        facility can often provide additional security measures, 
        such as two-factor authentication or support for strong passwords, 
        which can help to protect against unauthorized access to the DB2 system.

        In addition, using an external authentication facility
        can also make it easier to manage access for a large number of users, 
        as the facility can handle the authentication process and provide 
        the necessary credentials to the DB2 system, 
        without the need to manage individual user accounts within the DB2 system itself. 
        This can save time and resources, and reduce the potential for errors or inconsistencies
        in user access control.

Compare and contrast authorities and privileges. How well can they be compared to access control in the a system?

        Authorities and privileges are similar to access control in a system, 
        but they have some key differences.

        Authorities refer to the level of control that a user has over certain objects or resources 
        within the DB2 system. For example, a user may have the authority to create new tables, 
        or to update existing data within a database. 
        Authorities are typically granted to users based on their role within an organization, 
        and they can be customized to provide the specific level of control that is appropriate for each user.

        Privileges, on the other hand, refer to the specific actions that a user is allowed to perform 
        within the DB2 system. For example, a user may have the privilege to SELECT data 
        from a specific table, or to INSERT new records into a database. 
        Privileges are typically granted to users on an individual basis, 
        and they can be fine-tuned to allow or restrict specific actions within the DB2 system.

        Both authorities and privileges can be compared to access control in a system, 
        as they both determine what actions a user is allowed to perform within the DB2 system. 
        However, authorities tend to be more broad and apply to a group of users, 
        while privileges are more granular and apply to individual users. 
        In this way, authorities and privileges can work together 
        to provide a flexible and customizable system of access control within the DB2 system.


The following tasks can be handled by both the operating system and DB2, 
depending on the specific configuration and requirements of the system:

Creating a user/group: 
    This task is typically handled by the operating system, 
    as it involves creating a new user account with a specific username and password. 
    However, the DB2 system may also provide the ability to create users and groups within the database, 
    and to assign specific privileges and authorities to these users and groups.

Adding a user to a group:
    This task is typically handled by the operating system,
    as it involves assigning a user to a specific group of users within the system. 
    However, the DB2 system may also provide the ability to create and manage groups of users 
    within the database, and to assign specific privileges and authorities to these groups.

Authenticating a user (verifying identity):
    This task is typically handled by the operating system, 
    as it involves verifying the username and password of a user who is attempting to log into the system. 
    However, the DB2 system may also provide its own authentication mechanism, 
    which can be used to verify the identity of a user before allowing access to the database.

Giving privileges to a user/group:
    This task can be handled by both the operating system and the DB2 system. 
    The operating system may provide the ability to assign specific privileges to a user, 
    such as the ability to read or write files, or to run certain applications. 
    The DB2 system may also provide the ability to grant specific privileges to a user or group of users
    within the database, such as the ability to SELECT or INSERT data.

Giving authorities to a group:
    This task can also be handled by both the operating system and the DB2 system. 
    The operating system may provide the ability to assign specific authorities to a group of users, 
    such as the ability to manage user accounts or to access certain resources within the system. 
    The DB2 system may also provide the ability to grant specific authorities to a group of users 
    within the database, such as the ability to create or drop tables, 
    or to grant privileges to other users.

What is package?

    In the context of DB2 databases, 
    a package is a pre-compiled collection of SQL statements and control information 
    that is used to access data in a database. 
    A package typically contains a set of related SQL statements, 
    such as queries or updates, that are executed together to perform a specific task.

    Packages can be created by the DB2 system, or by users, 
    and they can be used to improve the performance of SQL statements 
    by reducing the amount of compilation and optimization that is required 
    each time the statements are executed. This can make it faster and more efficient 
    to access data in the database, especially for complex or frequently-used queries.

    Packages can also be used to improve the security of a DB2 database, 
    as they can provide a way to control access to specific sets of SQL statements, 
    and to grant or revoke privileges to users or groups of users. 
    This can help to ensure that only authorized users are able to access and manipulate data 
    in the database.

Static and dynamic embedded SQL are two different ways of incorporating SQL statements 
into a program written in a host language, such as C or COBOL. 
The main differences between static and dynamic embedded SQL are:

Static embedded SQL: 
    In static embedded SQL, 
    SQL statements are included directly in the source code of the host program,
    and they are compiled along with the rest of the program. 
    This means that the SQL statements are fixed and cannot be changed at runtime, 
    unless the source code is modified and recompiled. 
    Static embedded SQL is typically easier to use, 
    as it allows the SQL statements to be easily integrated into the host program, 
    and it can provide better performance, as the SQL statements are pre-compiled and optimized 
    at compile time.

Dynamic embedded SQL: 
    In dynamic embedded SQL, 
    SQL statements are not included directly in the source code of the host program. 
    Instead, they are stored in a separate file, 
    and they are passed to the DB2 system at runtime, 
    using a special API or interface. 
    This allows the SQL statements to be modified or changed at runtime, 
    without the need to recompile the host program. 
    Dynamic embedded SQL is more flexible, 
    as it allows the SQL statements to be easily changed 
    or adapted to different situations, but it can be more complex to use, 
    as it requires additional programming and coordination between the host program and the DB2 system.

Overall, 
the choice between static and dynamic embedded SQL depends on the specific requirements 
and goals of the host program. 
Static embedded SQL is typically better suited for programs that have well-defined and stable SQL 
statements that are not expected to change often, 
while dynamic embedded SQL is better suited 
for programs that need to be able to adapt to changing data or conditions at runtime.
