1.  To create a new group called "grpdb2a" and a user called "db2a" with the password "Lab5-Adm", 
    you will need to be logged in as a user with administrative privileges. 
    From the operating system, you can run the "compmgmt.msc" command to open the Computer Management tool. 
    From here, you can create the new group and user 
    by following the steps for creating a new group and user in the operating system you are using. 
    Once you have created the group and user, make sure to add the "db2a" user to the "grpdb2a" group, 
    the remote desktop user group, and make the user a local administrator.

2.  To create a new instance called "db2a", open a DB2 Command Window and enter the command "db2icrt db2a". 
    This should create a new service. To check that the service exists, 
    you can run the "services.msc" command and look for the new service in the list.

3.  Close all programs and log in as the "db2a" user. 
    It is important to make sure you are logged in as "db2a" for the next steps to work correctly.

4.  Open a DB2 Command Window and determine the current default instance by running the command "db2 get instance". 
    To change the default instance to "db2a", run the command "db2 update dbm cfg using instance db2a".

5.  To set the "SYSADM" group for the "db2a" instance to "grpdb2a", 
    run the command "db2 update dbm cfg using SYSADM_GROUP grpdb2a".

6.  Any changes made to the database manager configuration require recycling the instance before they take effect. 
    To start the "db2a" instance and apply the changes, run the command "db2start".

7.  To confirm that the current instance of the session is "db2a", run the command "db2 get instance".

8.  To create a new "SAMPLE" database in the "db2a" instance, run the "db2sampl" executable. 
    This will create a new directory under C:\ containing control information for the instance 
    and a subdirectory for the database. Make sure that the directories are created correctly.

1. 
DB2 UPDATE DBM CFG USING SYSADM_GROUP dbgrp
    This will add the "dbgrp" group, which Cathy is a member of, to the SYSADM group in the db2a instance.
DB2 GET DBM CFG | findstr "SYSADM_GROUP"
