2. Examine the operating system environment variable settings. What is the
DB2 instance currently set to? What is the installation path of DB2?

- List the current DB2 instance
    echo %DB2INSTANCE
        DB2
- What is the installation path of DB2

    - db2inst prof

    where db2.exe
        C:\Program Files\IBM\SQLLIB\BIN\db2.exe

3. What is the command to list out all the defined DB2 profile registry variables
for the DB2 server?

- db2set -all
    DB2_CLPPROMPT=NULL
    DB2INSTPROF=C:\DB2\\IBM\DB2\DB2COPY1
    DB2COMM=TCPIP

4. Is DB2COMM a valid DB2 profile registry variable? What command can be
    used to validate it?

Outputs value of variable
- db2set DB2COMM
    TCPIP

- db2set -lr  

If variable is not valid the output is 
    DBI1303W  Variable not set.

5. DB2COMM specifies the communication managers to be started when the
instance (also known as database manager) is started. This allows remote
connection to the databases defined in the instance via protocol set with this
DB2 profile registry variable. Set the DB2 profile registry variable
DB2COMM=TCPIP on instance level. If this is not set, no DB2
communications managers are started at the server

- db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP

6. Besides the DB2 instance, what other instances are defined in the DB2
server? 

- db2ilist
    DEVELOP     <--
    DB2

7. Obtain a list of databases within the DB2 instance.

- db2 list db directory

8. Create the SAMPLE database. An executable called db2sampl.exe comes
with the DB2 installation. It will create a SAMPLE database on the C drive
(by default), create tables, and populate them with sample data. Issue
db2sampl from the command window

- db2sampl

9. Obtain a list of databases within the DB2 instance again to verify SAMPLE
is created successfully.

- db2 list db directory

10. Connect to SAMPLE. List out all tables created in SAMPLE. How many
tables are created under userid/schema administrator?

- db2 connect to sample

- db2 list tables for User
    47

11. Open another DB2 Command Window. Find out how many connections are
made to the DB2 instance. What is the user id, application name, and
application handle for each connection to the SAMPLE database?

- db2 list application for db sample

12. Stop the DB2 instance from the second command window. What error do
you receive? Why?

- db2stop

Error: The database manager was not stopped because databases are still active.

13. 
 - services click stop 
 - close the window in which you connected to the database




14. Close the first command window. At the second command window, stop the
instance. Is the instance stopped?

- db2stop 

service ist not running
-> yes.

15. Start the DB2 instance.

-db2start 

service is running
-> yes

16. What command can be used to verify that for your running command window
command line processor option AUTOCOMMIT is on?

- db2 list command options
