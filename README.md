# esslingen_labore
All laboratory tasks of the University of Applied Sciences Esslingen. Solutions are without guarantee. I do not recommend copy and paste the solutions.

## Contributing

Just fork the repository, add your labs and create a Pull Request.
#### If you want to contribute you have to follow these requirements:
- Labs must be marked as passed
- File structure must be consistent with the other laboratories
    e.g. Individual subtasks in PGM are stored in their own folders which are labeled A1, A2, A3, etc.
- If the associated lecture is in English, all comments/explanations should also be in English.
