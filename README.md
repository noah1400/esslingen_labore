# esslingen_labore
All laboratory tasks of the University of Applied Sciences Esslingen. Solutions are without guarantee. I do not recommend copy and paste the solutions, if multiple students copy the solutions it can cause the plagiarism check algorithm to trigger.

#### Tasks are missing? 
Feel free to add them and help new students.
Just fork the repository, add your labs and create a Pull Request.

### **Please only add labs if they have been marked as passed.**
