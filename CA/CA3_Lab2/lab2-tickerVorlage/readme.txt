This project stationery is designed to get you up and running
quickly with CodeWarrior for MC9S12DP256B.
It is set up for the selected CPU and target connection,
but can be easily modified.

Sample code for the following language(s) is at your disposal:
- Relocatable Assembly

The wizard has prepared CodeWarrior target(s) with the connection methods of
your choice:
- Simulator:
  This interface/target is prepared to use the FCS (Full Chip Simulation).

- HCS12 Serial Monitor:
  This enables to debug with the HCS12 Serial Monitor target interface.
  The HCS12 Serial Monitor target interface connects to the HCS12 on-chip
  Motorola serial monitor.
  This monitor uses on-chip resources and the SCI. See Motorola
  application note AN2140 for details.
  The debugger is using GDI (Generic Debugging Interface) to connect to
  the serial monitor. Using the on-chip DBG module of HCS12 devices
  (if available, not present on all HCS12 derivatives), trace is supported
  as well. You can load the trace component
  using the menu Component > Open in the debugger.


Additional connections can be chosen in the simulator/debugger,
use the menu Component > Set Target.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Getting Started
//------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build/debug your project, use the menu Project > Debug or press F5.
This will open the simulator/debugger.
Press again F5 in the debugger (or menu Run > Start/Continue) to start
the application. The menu Run > Halt or F6 stops the application.
In the debugger menu Component > Open you can load additional components.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Project structure
//------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project generated contains various files/folders:
- readme.txt: this file
- Sources: folder with the application source code
- Prm:
   - burner.bbl file to generate S-Records
   - the linker .prm file
- Linker Map: the .map file generated by the linker
- Libraries: needed library files (ANSI, derivative header/implementation files)
- Debugger Project File: contains a .ini file for the debugger for each
  connection
- Debugger Cmd Files: contains sub-folders for each connection with command
  files

//------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Adding your own code
//------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once everything is working as expected, you can begin adding your own code
to the project. Keep in mind that we provide this as an example of how to
get up and running quickly with CodeWarrior. There are certainly other
ways to handle interrupts and set up your linker command file. Feel free
to modify any of the source files provided.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Simulator/Debugger: Additional components
//------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the simulator/debugger, you can load additional components. Try the menu
Component > Open.
